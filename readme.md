##Data input/output
The first step was to get the table from the word document into a format that python can read. For this test, the data was typed into a .csv file. If need be, a script can be written that converts the input data from the original format into a CSV.
##Using Pandas
I used the Pandas library to manipulate the data. It scales well to bigger data-sets and I have some experience using it.
##Getting something that works
The first step was to import the data and getting a way to output the assignments. After doing this, I spent some time to make some rules for assignment (like setting up a distance matrix and assigning the furthest two towers some frequencies and working from there), but after talking to some other engineers and doing some research, I decided to go with a more formal approach, namely defining an objective function and maximizing its output using some algorihm
